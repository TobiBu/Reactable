## Reactable

This Repo will contain my version of a Reactable software, a modular synthesizer developed within the Music Technology Group at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain by Sergi Jordà, Marcos Alonso, Martin Kaltenbrunner and Günter Geiger.

This project will use the reacTIVision software developed by Martin Kaltenbrunner and Ross Bencina.
It will make use of the pyo library, a python module for digital signal processing and the pytuio module for reading the tuio messages send by the reacTIVision software.
